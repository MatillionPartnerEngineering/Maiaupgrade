## Objective
Validate migrated pipelines for correctness and readiness.
Validation does NOT perform refactor.

---

## Inputs
- Workload folder: [FOLDER_NAME]
- pipeline_component_inventory.md
- migration_documentation.md (refactor rule reference only)

---

## Validation Scope

Validate all pipelines for:

1) YAML structure and syntax
2) Missing or invalid configuration
3) Dependency integrity
4) Archived or disabled pipelines
5) Runtime readiness signals

---

## Refactor Detection (Read-Only)

During validation, detect conditions that require refactor.

If detected:
- Update refactor_components.md
- Link to the correct **Upgrade:** section in migration_documentation.md
- Do NOT modify pipeline components

---

## 🧭 Refactor Detection Rules (Authoritative for Detection)

This section defines the **explicit conditions** that require a component to be
added or updated in `refactor_components.md`.

The **refactor method itself** must always be taken from
`migration_documentation.md`.

If a condition below is detected:
- Flag the component
- Assign severity
- Create or update the corresponding entry in `refactor_components.md`
- Link to the referenced section in `migration_documentation.md`
- Do NOT perform the refactor
